# Dyxa Guardian

**Dyxa Guardian** is a powerful code security analyzer designed to help developers identify vulnerabilities in their code. It supports multiple programming languages and provides detailed reports on security issues, making it an essential tool for secure software development.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Analyze code in Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.
- **Security Issue Detection**: Identify vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, insecure deserialization, and more.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Gradio for an easy-to-use and intuitive experience.
- **Export Reports**: Export analysis results in JSON, CSV, or PDF formats.
- **User Authentication**: Flask-based user registration and login system.
- **Code Metrics**: Analyze code complexity and lines of code (LOC).

## Usage

### Running the Gradio Interface
1. Start the Gradio app:
   ```bash
   python gradio_interface.py
   ```
2. Open the provided URL in your browser.
3. Paste your code into the input box, select the language, and click **Analyze Code**.
4. View the results, including vulnerability distribution, code metrics, and issue details.
5. Export the report in JSON, CSV, or PDF format.

### Running the Flask App
1. Start the Flask app for user authentication:
   ```bash
   python flask_app.py
   ```
2. Use the `/register` endpoint to create a new user and the `/login` endpoint to authenticate.
